These are plugins that are modified for a purpose.
I recommend using the [unmodified plugins](https://calmbubbles.github.io/js-plugins) if you are going to make something that is not intended in the modified ones.

> dialogueSys.js - Modified(more like originally made and is the first separate plugin of dialogueSys.js) for their birthday. This is where js-plugins started. Modifications added a logic for changing the interpolation mode of the dialogue portraits.
